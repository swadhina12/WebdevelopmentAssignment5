### Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Method of Promise?
Ans:Promises are a built-in feature in JavaScript that provide a way to handle asynchronous operations in a more organized and readable manner. A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to handle the result using a set of methods. Here are three commonly used methods of promises:

1-then():

* The then() method is used to handle the successful completion of a promise.
* It takes two optional callback functions as arguments: onFulfilled and onRejected.
* The onFulfilled callback is invoked when the promise is resolved, and it receives the resolved value as its argument.
* The onRejected callback is invoked when the promise is rejected, and it receives the rejection reason as its argument.
* The then() method returns a new promise, which allows chaining multiple asynchronous operations together.

Example:

```JavaScript
myPromise.then(
  function(result) {
    // Handle resolved value
  },
  function(error) {
    // Handle rejection
  }
);
```
2-catch():

* The catch() method is used to handle promise rejections.
* It takes a single callback function as an argument that handles the rejection reason.
* It is equivalent to calling .then(undefined, onRejected), allowing you to catch and handle errors in a more concise way.
* The catch() method returns a new promise, allowing for further chaining.

Example:

```JavaScript
myPromise.catch(function(error) {
  // Handle error
});
```

3-finally():
* The finally() method allows you to specify a callback function that will be executed regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected.
* It is commonly used for cleanup operations that need to be performed irrespective of the promise outcome.
* The finally() method returns a new promise, preserving the resolution or rejection value from the previous promise.

Example:

```JavaScript
myPromise.finally(function() {
  // Perform cleanup or final actions
});
```
These methods provide a structured way to handle the different outcomes of a promise: success, failure, and finalization. By using these methods, you can write cleaner and more maintainable code when dealing with asynchronous operations. Promises also facilitate the chaining of multiple asynchronous operations, enabling you to write sequential or parallel async code with ease.
