### Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch block?
Ans:The purpose of the try and catch blocks in JavaScript is to handle exceptions and gracefully manage errors that may occur during the execution of a block of code. Here's a breakdown of their purposes:

1-try block:

* The try block is used to enclose the code that might throw an exception or raise an error.
* It allows you to define a section of code where you anticipate potential errors.
* If an exception occurs within the try block, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the control is transferred to the associated catch block.

2-catch block:

* The catch block is used to specify the code that should execute when an exception is thrown within the associated try block.
* It allows you to handle the exception and provide an appropriate response or recovery mechanism.
* The catch block receives the exception object as a parameter, which contains information about the error that occurred.
* By handling exceptions in the catch block, you prevent the error from propagating further and potentially crashing the program.

The try-catch construct enables you to handle and manage errors in a controlled manner, ensuring that your program continues to run without abrupt terminations. Some common purposes of using try and catch blocks are:

1-Error handling:

* Catching exceptions with catch blocks allows you to handle errors gracefully instead of letting them crash the program.
* You can log the error, display a meaningful message to the user, or take alternative actions to recover from the error.

2-Fault tolerance:

* By encapsulating potentially error-prone code in a try block, you can prevent the entire program from failing due to an unexpected error in a specific section.
* It provides a way to isolate and manage errors so that the rest of the program can continue execution.

3-Robustness:

* try-catch blocks help make your code more robust by anticipating and handling exceptional conditions.
* They allow you to identify and resolve errors, improving the overall reliability and stability of your application.

4-Error reporting:

* Catching exceptions gives you the opportunity to log or report errors, which can be valuable for debugging and troubleshooting.
* You can analyze the reported errors to identify recurring issues and improve the quality of your code.

Overall, the purpose of try and catch blocks is to handle exceptions, provide error recovery mechanisms, and maintain the stability and resilience of your JavaScript programs.
