### Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

Ans:To define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await, you need to follow these steps:

1-Use the async keyword:

* Begin by using the async keyword before the function declaration.
* This indicates that the function will contain asynchronous code and will return a promise implicitly.

Example:
```JavaScript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // Asynchronous code goes here
}
```

2-Use the await keyword:

* Within the async function, you can use the await keyword to pause the execution and wait for a promise to resolve or reject.
* The await keyword can only be used within an async function.

Example:
```JavaScript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  // Use the resolved value of the promise
}
```
3-Invoke asynchronous operations:

* Within the async function, you can invoke other asynchronous functions or operations that return promises.
* Use the await keyword before the asynchronous operation to pause the execution until the promise is resolved or rejected.
* The await expression will evaluate to the resolved value of the promise.

Example:
```JavaScript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const result1 = await someAsyncOperation1();
  const result2 = await someAsyncOperation2();
  // Use the resolved values of the promises
}
```
4-Handle errors:

* Use try-catch blocks to handle errors that may occur during the execution of the await expressions.
* Wrap the await expression within a try block and catch any errors in the associated catch block.

Example:
```JavaScript
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    // Use the resolved value of the promise
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle any errors
  }
}
```
By defining an asynchronous function using async/await, you can write asynchronous code in a more sequential and synchronous-like manner, making it easier to read and maintain. The async keyword indicates that the function is asynchronous, while the await keyword allows you to pause the execution and wait for promises to resolve.
