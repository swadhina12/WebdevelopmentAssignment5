###  Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval?
Ans:setTimeout and setInterval are JavaScript functions used for scheduling the execution of code at specified time intervals.

setTimeout:
setTimeout is used to execute a function or a code snippet once after a specified delay (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: a function or code to be executed and the delay in milliseconds.

Example usage:

```JavaScript
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed code execution");
}, 2000); // Execute after a 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) delay
```

In the example above, the function console.log("Delayed code execution") will be executed once after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

setInterval:
setInterval is used to repeatedly execute a function or a code snippet at a specified time interval (in milliseconds). It takes two arguments: a function or code to be executed and the time interval between each execution.

Example usage:

```JavaScript
setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Repeated code execution");
}, 1000); // Execute every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
```

In the example above, the function console.log("Repeated code execution") will be executed repeatedly every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) until the setInterval is cleared or the page is unloaded.

Both setTimeout and setInterval return a unique identifier that can be used to clear or cancel the scheduled execution. The identifier can be passed to the clearTimeout or clearInterval functions respectively.

Example of clearing a timeout:

```JavaScript
const timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("Delayed code execution");
}, 2000);

// Clear the timeout before it executes
clearTimeout(timeoutId);
Example of clearing an interval:

javascript
Copy code
const intervalId = setInterval(function() {
  console.log("Repeated code execution");
}, 1000);

// Clear the interval after a specific number of executions
setTimeout(function() {
  clearInterval(intervalId);
}, 5000); // Clear the interval after 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds)
```
In summary, setTimeout is used to execute code once after a specified delay, while setInterval is used to repeatedly execute code at a specified time interval.
