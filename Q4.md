### Q.4 What are the ways we have to handle Async Code in JS?
In JavaScript, there are several ways to handle asynchronous code to ensure proper execution and avoid blocking the main thread. Here are some commonly used methods:

1-Callbacks:

* Callbacks are a traditional method for handling asynchronous code in JavaScript.
* A callback function is passed as an argument to an asynchronous function.
* When the asynchronous operation completes, the callback function is invoked to handle the result.
* Callbacks can lead to callback hell or the pyramid of doom when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations nested within each other, making the code harder to read and maintain.

2-Promises:

* Promises provide a more structured approach to handle asynchronous operations.
* A promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allows chaining operations.
* Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.
* They can be used with the .then() method to handle successful completion and the .catch() method to handle errors.
Promises help avoid callback hell and make asynchronous code more readable and manageable.

3-Async/Await:

* Async/await is a modern approach to handle asynchronous code introduced in ECMAScript 2017 (ES8).
* The async keyword is used to define an asynchronous function that returns a promise implicitly.
* The await keyword is used within an async function to pause execution and wait for a promise to resolve or reject before proceeding.
* Async/await provides a more synchronous-like style of coding, making asynchronous code easier to read and write.
* Error handling can be done using traditional try-catch blocks.

4-Event Emitters:

* Event emitters follow the observer pattern and are commonly used in event-driven architectures.
* An event emitter object emits events, and listeners are registered to handle those events asynchronously.
* This approach is useful when dealing with scenarios where events occur over time and need to be handled asynchronously.

5-Reactive Extensions (RxJS):

* RxJS is a library that brings reactive programming concepts to JavaScript.
* It provides an extensive set of operators and abstractions for handling asynchronous operations.
* Observables, which are the core concept in RxJS, allow you to represent streams of data and perform various operations on them.
* RxJS provides powerful tools for managing complex asynchronous scenarios.

Each method has its advantages and use cases, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of your project and the familiarity of the development team. Promises and async/await are increasingly popular due to their readability and ease of use. Event emitters and RxJS are more suitable for scenarios involving event-driven or stream-based programming.
