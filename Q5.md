### Q.5 What are Callbacks & Explain Callback Hell ?
Ans:Callbacks are a common programming pattern in JavaScript where a function is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time or when a certain condition is met. In other words, a callback is a function that is invoked by another function once a particular task or event is completed.

Callback Hell, also known as the Pyramid of Doom, is a situation that arises when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations or nested callbacks. It occurs when callbacks are nested within each other, leading to code that is difficult to read, understand, and maintain.

Here's an example of callback hell:

```JavaScript
asyncOperation1(function(result1) {
  // First operation completed
  asyncOperation2(result1, function(result2) {
    // Second operation completed
    asyncOperation3(result2, function(result3) {
      // Third operation completed
      asyncOperation4(result3, function(result4) {
        // Fourth operation completed
        // ...and so on
      });
    });
  });
});
```

In the example above, each async operation depends on the result of the previous one. As a result, the code becomes deeply nested, making it harder to follow the logic and causing readability issues. Additionally, error handling can become cumbersome as it needs to be handled at each level of the callback chain.

Callback Hell can be mitigated by using techniques such as modularization, promises, and async/await. Here's an example using promises:

```JavaScript
asyncOperation1()
  .then(function(result1) {
    // First operation completed
    return asyncOperation2(result1);
  })
  .then(function(result2) {
    // Second operation completed
    return asyncOperation3(result2);
  })
  .then(function(result3) {
    // Third operation completed
    return asyncOperation4(result3);
  })
  .then(function(result4) {
    // Fourth operation completed
    // ...and so on
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    // Handle errors
  });
```
In this modified version, promises are used to chain the asynchronous operations, making the code more readable and easier to understand. Additionally, error handling is consolidated in a single catch block.

Alternatively, async/await, introduced in ES2017, provides a more concise and synchronous-like syntax for handling asynchronous operations:

```JavaScript
async function performOperations() {
  try {
    const result1 = await asyncOperation1();
    // First operation completed

    const result2 = await asyncOperation2(result1);
    // Second operation completed

    const result3 = await asyncOperation3(result2);
    // Third operation completed

    const result4 = await asyncOperation4(result3);
    // Fourth operation completed

    // ...and so on
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
  }
}
```
performOperations();
Using async/await, the code appears more sequential and readable, resembling synchronous code flow, while still being non-blocking and asynchronous behind the scenes.

Overall, callbacks are a powerful technique for handling asynchronous operations, but nesting them excessively can lead to callback hell. By adopting promises or async/await syntax, the code can be structured in a more readable and maintainable way.
