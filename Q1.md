### Q1-Whatâ€™s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?
Ans:Synchronous and asynchronous are two different modes of communication or processing that describe how events or actions are coordinated and executed. Here's the difference between them:

> Synchronous:

1-In synchronous communication or processing, tasks are performed in a sequential and blocking manner.

2-When a synchronous task is initiated, the program waits for that task to complete before moving on to the next task.

3-Synchronous communication is characterized by a two-way interaction where the sender waits for a response from the receiver before continuing.

4-Examples of synchronous communication include phone calls, in-person conversations, or traditional client-server interactions where the client waits for a server response.

> Asynchronous:

1-In asynchronous communication or processing, tasks are performed independently and non-blocking.

2-When an asynchronous task is initiated, the program does not wait for it to complete and can continue with other tasks.

3-Asynchronous communication allows for one-way interactions, where the sender initiates a task and continues without waiting for a response.

4-Examples of asynchronous communication include email, text messaging, or asynchronous web requests where the client sends a request and continues processing without waiting for the response.

>Key differences between synchronous and asynchronous:

1-Blocking: Synchronous tasks block the execution until they are completed, while asynchronous tasks do not block and allow other tasks to proceed.

2-Waiting: Synchronous tasks wait for a response or completion, whereas asynchronous tasks do not wait and continue with other operations.

3-Interaction: Synchronous communication involves two-way interaction, while asynchronous communication can be one-way.

4-Parallelism: Asynchronous tasks can be executed in parallel or concurrently, whereas synchronous tasks are executed sequentially.

In summary, synchronous communication or processing is characterized by sequential and blocking operations, while asynchronous communication or processing allows for non-blocking and independent tasks. The choice between synchronous and asynchronous depends on the specific requirements of the system or application being developed.
