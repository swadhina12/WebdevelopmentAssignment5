### Q.7 Whatâ€™s Async & Await Keyword in JavaScript?
Ans:The async and await keywords are part of the asynchronous programming model introduced in JavaScript with the ES2017 (ES8) specification. They provide a more concise and synchronous-like syntax for working with asynchronous operations, such as promises.

1-async Keyword:
The async keyword is used to define a function as asynchronous. When a function is marked as async, it always returns a promise. The promise is automatically created and resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an error thrown from within the function.

Example usage:

```JavaScript
async function fetchData() {
  // Asynchronous code here
  return await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
}
```

In the example above, the fetchData function is marked as async. It performs an asynchronous operation by making a network request using the fetch API. The function returns a promise that resolves to the fetched data.

2-await Keyword:
The await keyword can only be used inside an async function. It is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved or rejected. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code.

Example usage:

```JavaScript
async function processData() {
  try {
    const data = await fetchData();
    // Code here executes after the promise is resolved
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    // Error handling
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```
In the example above, the processData function is marked as async. It calls the fetchData function using await, which pauses the execution of processData until the promise returned by fetchData is resolved or rejected. Once the promise is resolved, the code resumes execution, and the fetched data is logged to the console. If an error occurs, it is caught and handled in the catch block.

The combination of async and await provides a cleaner and more readable way to write asynchronous code compared to using callbacks or chaining promises. It allows developers to write asynchronous operations in a sequential and synchronous-like manner, making code easier to understand and maintain.

It's important to note that the await keyword can only be used within an async function, and it can only be used on expressions that return promises. If a non-promise value is passed to await, it is automatically wrapped in a resolved promise.
